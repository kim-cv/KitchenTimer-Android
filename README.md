# Kitchen Timer

I released an Android kitchen timer app in 28-07-2016 which was made entirely with Android + Java

Now I'm rewriting the app with up-to-date Android tech and best practices in mind.

- Languages: Kotlin, Java, XML
- Patterns: Databinding, MVVM, Repository
- Android tech used: Broadcast receiver, Foreground Service, Notifications, AlarmManager, MediaPlayer, BindingAdapters, FileSystem, SharedPreferences.
